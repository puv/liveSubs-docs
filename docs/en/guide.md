#### Because the app is not signed (which costs money), you may get a warning from your browser or Windows. This application is safe to use, and you can check the source code [here](https://github.com/puv/liveSubs).

2. If you get a warning from your browser, click "..." or "More", and then click "Keep"

It would be very nice if you could click "Report as safe", as it would help other people who want to use liveSubs.
If asked wether you're sure, click "Keep anyway".
